title: "Attending SIGCSE for CS mentorship training"

The SIGCSE conference is being held in Seattle next week and I got a travel award from CRA-W (apparently accronym for Early Career Mentoring Workshop, quite ironic though!), yeaaay!!! 

With the information I got so far and the preparation steps including a self-evaluation survay, it sounds like a good opportunity for professional training on mentorship and supervision in Computer Science, which will come handy soon.


Thanks to my friend [Fatemeh Sharifi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fatemeh_Sharifi) for telling me about [this event](http://cra.org/cra-w/events/sigcse-2017-cra-w-career-mentoring-workshop/)!
