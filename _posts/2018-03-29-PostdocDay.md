The SFU Postdoc Research Day, which was held on March 28, was an amazing event for everybody to participate. Postdocs from so many different disciplines gathered to present their research for a general audience. Later in the day, we socialized, and some of the presentations were awarded. My 10min spotlight talk on "Combining Forces to Fight Fake News" was selected as the third best talk of the day :)
