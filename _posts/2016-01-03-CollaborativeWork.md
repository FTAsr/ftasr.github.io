With more students starting to work with me on Natural Language Processing projects, I thought to make a few posts on collaboration basics. Hopefully, these posts will help us plan and pursue our projets more efficiently and enjoy a distinguishable team work. 
This first post contains some general notes on teamwork and some more specific information on collaborative development, i.e., programing the general framework or integrative components of a system that performs a certain NLP task.

# General notes on teamwork
Internet is full of blog posts and articles on the fundamentals of teamwork. Here I try to write a summary of the very basics, things that I consider my collaborators should also take into account for us to work happily together.

## Introduce yourself and your interests

It is important to introduce yourself as clearly as possible when you start working with a new group. It will help them identify your skills, interests, potentials and goals for suggesting the best fitting project to you. Therefore remember these four keywords and make sure you talk about them in your first meeting with the project manager or the main collaborator. If you hope to get financial help, have a publication, or someone to support you as a recommendation letter writer at the end, you should consider mentioning that in your conversation. For example some labs have a very good reputation or might help you get handson experience with some new techniques or research areas but cannot offer money or resources. So, be clear from the very first!

## Be ready to learn and teach

Starting any type of collaboration needs motivation and patience. If you miss one of these, teamwork does not suit you. Regardless of you being superior or not in the share of knowledge and skills you're bringing into the project, you should always be welcome to new approaches, ideas and strategies. I personally, believe in the famous quotes of Steve Jobs "Stay hungry. Stay foolish." The first part suggest that you should always push yourself to learn and experience different things. The second part though, means you should trust your intuition as well, thus don't be afraid of sharing your ideas if you think something needs to be done differently, reason about it! It is usually perceived positively when you introduce a new technique or tools that the other people in the group have not been aware of... but don't insist too much, specially if you're being supervised by a more senior and experiences fellow! Instead, try to make it work and come back with good results. In other words, be responsible about what you propose and everybody will be happy in the end even though you might seem stupid at the beginning ;)

## Be reliable
 
Reliability is sometimes more important than performance. When people invest their time and energy to share their ideas and work with you, it means that they trust you. Make sure you keep in touch with your collaborators, even if you need a break, you're too busy to work on the project for a while, or need to postpone a delivery. If you need to figure out a new schedual for yourself, let your supervisor know you'd be away for a while (in such situations, I usually tell them "I'll send an email when the next part is ready but it will be *in February/within a month/week/...*"). Another important point is regarding sharing privileges: inform your collaborators in advance and get permission if you're sharing data, code or unpublished results with someone outside the project. Finally, make sure you share your contribution fully with the project manager or supervisor. Leaving without a useful delivery (complete or easily extendible code/documentation) would be considered as if you waisted other people's time. Not a fruitful collaboration for your partners, not a beneficial practice for yourself in longterm either.

This section contains information on tools and techniques we use for making longterm contributions to the projects, the labs we're working with, as well as to the field (by sharing open-source code, publishing APIs, toolkits and technical papers).
