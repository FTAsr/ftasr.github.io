I have been selected as a finalist of the 2018 round of [Canada's Entrepreneurial AI Initiative, NextAI](https://www.nextcanada.com/next-ai). Now with the other finalists from technical and business tracks, we're teaming up to propose AI solutions to real-world problems and initiate startups with the help of the facilitator program. Canada has entrepreneurs too, and in AI!
