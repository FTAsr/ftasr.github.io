Next week, I will present my work on "Different Layers of Distributional Semantics" at the 47th Annual Meeting of the Society for Computers in Psychology, Convention Center, Vancouver. Conference theme is "Big Data and Deep Learning", and the registration fee is quite affordable compared to ACL conferences and even CogSci. I recommend it specially if you're interested in computational (psycho)linguistics. The program is available at http://scip.ws
