title: "Moving to Canada"

I am about to move to Canada, Vancouver area, for a new position at Simon Fraser University. My new topic of research will be on fake news detection in social media. I'm quite excited to start a new interdisciplinary research at a linguistics department after my sweet experience at the psychology department of IU. I will miss Bloomington with all the great people and the University's vibrant environment... but life is so. I hope that I've "fulfilled my promises" before "engaging the world"!



P.S.: "Fulfilling the promise" and "Engaging the world" are IU and SFU's slogans, respectively :)
