## Fatemeh Torabi Asr

I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at the [Discourse Processing  Lab](http://www.sfu.ca/discourse-lab.html) within the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.sfu.ca/linguistics.html) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca). 
With a background in software engineering and research experience in the area of cognitive computing and computational linguistics (NLP), I aim at understanding [semantic processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_processing) in human brain and developing language-intelligent systems that benefit human society. My current research is focused on social media and news text analysis for the purposes of misinformation detection and gender gap tracking in media.
