## Fatemeh Torabi Asr

I am a post-doctoral fellow at the [Cognitive Computing Lab](http://www.compcog.com/) within the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](http://psych.indiana.edu/) at [Indiana University (Bloomington)](https://www.indiana.edu). With a background in software engineering and research experience in the area of cognitive computing and computational linguistics (NLP), I aim at understanding [semantic processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_processing) in human brain and developing language-intelligent systems that benefit human society.
