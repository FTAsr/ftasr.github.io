## What is my research about?

1) Studying language aquisition and human communication by computational modeling, lab experiments and crowd sourcing. <br>
2) Large-scale text analysis to understand discourse semantics/structures and relating it to psychological and social behavior. <br>
3) Development of natural language processing systems for real-world tasks such as short answer scoring using latest machine learning techniques. <br>

### Current Projects

- Evaluation of predictive and count-based distributional semantic models (Collaboration with University of California, Riverside (CA), USA)
- Modeling the meaning of discourse connectives in a distributional vector space
- Authomated scoring of student answers in tutoring systems (Collaboration with Purdue University, USA)
- Evaluation of standard schema for annotation of discourse relations (Collaboration with Saarland University, Germany and University of Utrecht, Netherlands)

### Past Projects
- Application of information theory to production and comprehension of discourse markers (My PhD thesis)
- Event detection and coreference analysis in large-scale text corpora (My project during an internship at University of Potsdam, Germany)
- Computational modeling of word category acquisition (My Master's thesis, Collaboration with University of Toronto)
- Heuristic search in automated Chinese Checkers players (My Bachlor's project, Collaboration with University of Alberta)
