## What is my research about?

- Studying language acquisition and human communication through computational modeling, lab experiments and crowd sourcing.<br>
- Large-scale text analysis to understand discourse semantics/structures and relating it to psychological and social phenomena.<br>
- Development of natural language processing systems for real-world tasks such as short answer scoring using latest machine learning techniques.<br>

## Current Projects
- News text analysis and automatic misinformation detection using Deep Learning 
- Modeling the meaning of discourse connectives through distributional semantics

## Past Projects
- Evaluation of classic and neural models of distributional semantics (Work at Indiana University, see our NAACL 2018 paper) 
- Automated scoring of student answers in tutoring systems (Work at Indiana University in collaboration with Purdue University, USA)
- Evaluation of standard schema for annotation of discourse relations (Collaboration between Saarland University, Germany and University of Utrecht, Netherlands)
- Application of information theory to production and comprehension of discourse markers (My PhD thesis)
- Event detection and coreference analysis in large-scale text corpora (My project during an internship at University of Potsdam, Germany)
- Computational modeling of word category acquisition (My Master's thesis, Collaboration with University of Toronto)
- Heuristic search in artificial game players (My Bachelor's project, Collaboration with University of Alberta)
